**Project Overview**  
This project implements a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline for fish species classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project was developed as part of a machine learning class assignment to demonstrate hands-on experience with image classification tasks.

**Objective**  
Build a comprehensive image classification system that can accurately classify different fish species from images, covering the entire ML pipeline from data acquisition to model deployment.

**Dataset**
* Source: Fish image dataset from Google Drive
* Structure: Organized into train/test/val splits with multiple fish species classes
* Format: RGB images of various fish species
* Preprocessing: Includes normalization, resizing, and augmentation

**Key Findings**
* Transfer learning significantly improves performance over training from scratch
* Data augmentation reduces overfitting and improves generalization
* Class balancing is crucial for multi-class imbalanced datasets
* Fine-tuning yields the best results for domain-specific tasks

**Future Improvements**
* Implement additional pre-trained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet)
* Add attention mechanisms for better feature extraction
* Implement ensemble methods for improved accuracy
* Develop web application interface
* Add real-time prediction capabilities
* Incorporate explainable AI techniques (Grad-CAM, LIME)
